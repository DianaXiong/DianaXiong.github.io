      <title>LightUrban: Similarity Based Fine-grained Instancing for Lightweighting Complex Urban Point Clouds</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Large-scale urban point clouds play a vital role in various applications, while rendering and transmitting such data remains challenging due to its large volume, complicated structures, and significant redundancy. In this paper, we present LightUrban, the first point cloud instancing framework for efficient rendering and transmission of fine-grained complex urban scenes. We first introduce a segmentation method to organize the point clouds into individual buildings and vegetation instances from coarse to fine.Next, we propose an unsupervised similarity detection approach to accurately group instances with similar shapes. Furthermore, a fast pose and size estimation component is applied to calculate the transformations between the representative instance and the corresponding similar instances in each group. By replacing individual instances with their group&amp;rsquo;s representative instances, the data volume and redundancy can be dramatically reduced. Experimental results on large-scale urban scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. To sum up, our method not only structures the urban point clouds but also significantly reduces data volume and redundancy, filling the gap in point cloud instancing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TwinTex: Geometry-aware Texture Generation for Abstracted 3D Architectural Models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coarse architectural models are often generated at scales ranging from individual buildings to scenes for downstream applications such as Digital Twin City, Metaverse, LODs, etc. Such piece-wise planar models can be abstracted as twins from 3D dense reconstructions. However, these models typically lack realistic texture relative to the real building or scene, making them unsuitable for vivid display or direct reference. In this paper, we present TwinTex, the first automatic texture mapping framework to generate a photo-realistic texture for a piece-wise planar proxy. Our method addresses most challenges occurring in such twin texture generation. Specifically, for each primitive plane, we first select a small set of photos with greedy heuristics considering photometric quality, perspective quality and facade texture completeness. Then, different levels of line features (LoLs) are extracted from the set of selected photos to generate guidance for later steps. With LoLs, we employ optimization algorithms to align texture with geometry from local to global. Finally, we fine-tune a diffusion model with a multi-mask initialization component and a new dataset to inpaint the missing region. Experimental results on many buildings, indoor scenes and man-made objects of varying complexity demonstrate the generalization ability of our algorithm. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art texture mapping methods in terms of high-fidelity quality and reaches a human-expert production level with much less effort.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ShapeArchit: Shape-inspired Architecture Design with Space Planning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Various techniques have been proposed to improve the level of automation in architectural design life-cycle. We present an interactive interface, along with geometric algorithms focused on designing early stage symbolic architecture. First, the architect specifies some simple shape requirements by inputting a few binary images that resemble the shape of the building from different viewpoints. These are used to generate a conceptual design that is guided by various aesthetic and structural requirements. Second, we explore an interactive technique in planning the inner space of the given architecture model. The architect specifies the ideal requirements on the key functional rooms by using instances of simple 3D primitive shapes. The pose and location of each instance are parameters in multi-objectives. By coupling this process together with the shape inspired exterior design process, we can construct good initial conceptual designs. To solve these problems, we develop modified cuckoo search algorithms. Furthermore, a novel iterative mesh smoothing algorithm that yields a smooth surface while preserving sharp creases and generating roof structures is also developed. Several examples are presented to illustrate the methodology and results. User studies based on a proposed dataset and interviews with domain experts have been carried out to demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of our system and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rationalizing Architectural Surfaces Based on Clustering of Joints</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce the problem of clustering the set of vertices in a given 3D mesh. The problem is motivated by the need for value engineering in architectural projects. We first derive a max-norm based metric to estimate the geometric disparity between a given pair of vertices, and characterize the problem in terms of this measure. We show that this distance can be computed by using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). Next we introduce two different algorithms for clustering the set of vertices on a given mesh, respectively based on two disparity measurements: max-norm and L2-norm based metric. An equivalence is established between mesh vertices and physical joints in an architectural mesh. By replacing individual joints by their equivalent cluster representative, the number of unique joints in the facade mesh, and therefore the fabrication cost, is dramatically reduced. Finally, we present an algorithm for remeshing a given surface in order to further reduce the number of joint clusters. The framework is tested for a set of real-world architectural surfaces to illustrate the effectiveness and utility of our approach. Overall, this approach tackles the important problem reducing fabrication cost of joints without modifying the underlying connectivity that was specified by the architect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a method to design architectural buildings that are inspired by shapes of non-architectural forms. The user inputs a few binary images, each providing an indicative shape for the building from a different viewpoint. A discrete visual hull corresponding to each binary image is generated. A voxel model is then constructed by intersecting the hulls corresponding to the images. The shape of the voxel model depends on the parameters of the projections. Real buildings must also obey some topological and structural constraints. We develop a shape metric to evaluate a given design in terms of topological, functional and structural requirements of the building. This allows us to optimize the building shape as a function of the parameters of the projection. The optimization problem is solved by means of an improved cuckoo search metaheuristic. The resulting voxel model is converted into a mesh model. Finally, we apply a novel smoothing algorithm that produces a smooth surface while preserving sharp creases and roof structures. Several examples are presented in the paper to illustrate the methodology and results.&lt;/p&gt;
