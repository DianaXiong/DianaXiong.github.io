      <description>&lt;p&gt;Various techniques have been proposed to improve the level of automation in architectural design life-cycle. We present an interactive interface, along with geometric algorithms focused on designing early stage symbolic architecture. First, the architect specifies some simple shape requirements by inputting a few binary images that resemble the shape of the building from different viewpoints. These are used to generate a conceptual design that is guided by various aesthetic and structural requirements. Second, we explore an interactive technique in planning the inner space of the given architecture model. The architect specifies the ideal requirements on the key functional rooms by using instances of simple 3D primitive shapes. The pose and location of each instance are parameters in multi-objectives. By coupling this process together with the shape inspired exterior design process, we can construct good initial conceptual designs. To solve these problems, we develop modified cuckoo search algorithms. Furthermore, a novel iterative mesh smoothing algorithm that yields a smooth surface while preserving sharp creases and generating roof structures is also developed. Several examples are presented to illustrate the methodology and results. User studies based on a proposed dataset and interviews with domain experts have been carried out to demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of our system and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a method to design architectural buildings that are inspired by shapes of non-architectural forms. The user inputs a few binary images, each providing an indicative shape for the building from a different viewpoint. A discrete visual hull corresponding to each binary image is generated. A voxel model is then constructed by intersecting the hulls corresponding to the images. The shape of the voxel model depends on the parameters of the projections. Real buildings must also obey some topological and structural constraints. We develop a shape metric to evaluate a given design in terms of topological, functional and structural requirements of the building. This allows us to optimize the building shape as a function of the parameters of the projection. The optimization problem is solved by means of an improved cuckoo search metaheuristic. The resulting voxel model is converted into a mesh model. Finally, we apply a novel smoothing algorithm that produces a smooth surface while preserving sharp creases and roof structures. Several examples are presented in the paper to illustrate the methodology and results.&lt;/p&gt;
