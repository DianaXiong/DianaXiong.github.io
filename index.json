We present an interactive interface, along with geometric algorithms focused on designing early stage symbolic architecture. First, the architect specifies some simple shape requirements by inputting a few binary images that resemble the shape of the building from different viewpoints. These are used to generate a conceptual design that is guided by various aesthetic and structural requirements. Second, we explore an interactive technique in planning the inner space of the given architecture model. The architect specifies the ideal requirements on the key functional rooms by using instances of simple 3D primitive shapes. The pose and location of each instance are parameters in multi-objectives. By coupling this process together with the shape inspired exterior design process, we can construct good initial conceptual designs. To solve these problems, we develop modified cuckoo search algorithms. Furthermore, a novel iterative mesh smoothing algorithm that yields a smooth surface while preserving sharp creases and generating roof structures is also developed. Several examples are presented to illustrate the methodology and results. User studies based on a proposed dataset and interviews with domain experts have been carried out to demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of our system and algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"ShapeArchit: Shape-inspired Architecture Design with Space Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630425600,"objectID":"30cb3eca1e4d790020b90291c3462017","permalink":"/talk/2021workshop/","publishdate":"2021-08-31T16:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2021workshop/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Architectural Design from Sketches","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Weidan Xiong**","Chong Mo Cheung","Pedro V.
