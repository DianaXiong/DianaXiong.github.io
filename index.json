However, these models typically lack realistic texture relative to the real building or scene, making them unsuitable for vivid display or direct reference. In this paper, we present TwinTex, the first automatic texture mapping framework to generate a photo-realistic texture for a piece-wise planar proxy. Our method addresses most challenges occurring in such twin texture generation. Specifically, for each primitive plane, we first select a small set of photos with greedy heuristics considering photometric quality, perspective quality and facade texture completeness. Then, different levels of line features (LoLs) are extracted from the set of selected photos to generate guidance for later steps. With LoLs, we employ optimization algorithms to align texture with geometry from local to global. Finally, we fine-tune a diffusion model with a multi-mask initialization component and a new dataset to inpaint the missing region. Experimental results on many buildings, indoor scenes and man-made objects of varying complexity demonstrate the generalization ability of our algorithm. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art texture mapping methods in terms of high-fidelity quality and reaches a human-expert production level with much less effort.\n","date":1691193600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691193600,"objectID":"28390aa261037b908629002623c9e324","permalink":"/project/twintex/","publishdate":"2023-08-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/twintex/","section":"project","summary":"ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proceedings of SIGGRAPH Asia 2023)","tags":null,"title":"TwinTex: Geometry-aware Texture Generation for Abstracted 3D Architectural Models","type":"project"},{"authors":["黄惠","**熊卫丹**","张洪芊"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689609600,"objectID":"2619b6f59c397367daa9cbdb1157a4cb","permalink":"/patent/textureselection/","publishdate":"2023-07-18T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/patent/textureselection/","section":"patent","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"一种用于纹理贴图的视角选择和纹理对齐方法及相关设备","type":"patent"},{"authors":["Tianyu Zhou","**Weidan Xiong**","Yuki Obata","Carlos Lange","Yongsheng Ma"],"categories":null,"content":"Digital Manufacturing: The Industrialization of \u0026ldquo;Art to Part\u0026rdquo; 3D Additive Printing explains everything needed to understand how recent advances in materials science, manufacturing engineering and digital design have integrated to create exciting new capabilities.

The problem is motivated by the need for value engineering in architectural projects. We first derive a max-norm based metric to estimate the geometric disparity between a given pair of vertices, and characterize the problem in terms of this measure. We show that this distance can be computed by using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). Next we introduce two different algorithms for clustering the set of vertices on a given mesh, respectively based on two disparity measurements: max-norm and L2-norm based metric. An equivalence is established between mesh vertices and physical joints in an architectural mesh. By replacing individual joints by their equivalent cluster representative, the number of unique joints in the facade mesh, and therefore the fabrication cost, is dramatically reduced. Finally, we present an algorithm for remeshing a given surface in order to further reduce the number of joint clusters. The framework is tested for a set of real-world architectural surfaces to illustrate the effectiveness and utility of our approach. Overall, this approach tackles the important problem reducing fabrication cost of joints without modifying the underlying connectivity that was specified by the architect.\n","date":1624147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624147200,"objectID":"9c1711282323344e38c6e9aa00d54f82","permalink":"/project/remeshing/","publishdate":"2021-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/remeshing/","section":"project","summary":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","tags":null,"title":"Rationalizing Architectural Surfaces Based on Clustering of Joints","type":"project"},{"authors":["**Weidan Xiong**","Chong Mo Cheung","Pedro V.

The user inputs a few binary images, each providing an indicative shape for the building from a different viewpoint. A discrete visual hull corresponding to each binary image is generated. A voxel model is then constructed by intersecting the hulls corresponding to the images. The shape of the voxel model depends on the parameters of the projections. Real buildings must also obey some topological and structural constraints. We develop a shape metric to evaluate a given design in terms of topological, functional and structural requirements of the building. This allows us to optimize the building shape as a function of the parameters of the projection. The optimization problem is solved by means of an improved cuckoo search metaheuristic. The resulting voxel model is converted into a mesh model. Finally, we apply a novel smoothing algorithm that produces a smooth surface while preserving sharp creases and roof structures. Several examples are presented in the paper to illustrate the methodology and results.\n","date":1519084800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519084800,"objectID":"8f1764f8ec46176ba8fc7c1eb514b566","permalink":"/project/shape/","publishdate":"2018-02-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/shape/","section":"project","summary":"ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games","tags":null,"title":"Shape-inspired Architecture Design","type":"project"},{"authors":["**Weidan Xiong**","Pengbo Zhang","Pedro V.
